  <h1>Company Policies</h1>

  <h2>1. General Sales Policy</h2>
  <p>All sales are considered <strong>final</strong> upon completion of purchase and delivery/collection of goods.</p>
  <p>We strongly advise all customers to carefully inspect the product(s), check compatibility, specifications, condition, and suitability <strong>before completing the purchase</strong>. Once the transaction is completed, we are unable to accept returns for change of mind, incorrect selection, or buyer's remorse.</p>

  <h2>2. Returns & Refunds</h2>
  <p class="highlight">We do NOT offer returns or refunds for change of mind.</p>
  <p>Products are sold "as is" after purchase. Customers are responsible for ensuring the item meets their requirements prior to buying.</p>

  <h2>3. Exchange Policy (Limited Conditions)</h2>
  <p>We may consider an exchange (replacement with the same item) only under the following strict conditions:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The request is made <strong>within 7 calendar days</strong> from the date of purchase/delivery</li>
   <li>The product is <strong>unused, in completely new condition</strong>, with all original packaging, tags, manuals, and accessories intact</li>
   <li>The original receipt/invoice and proof of purchase is presented</li>
   <li>The product is found to have a genuine manufacturing defect upon our inspection</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All exchange requests are subject to final approval after physical inspection by our team.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We reserve the right to refuse any exchange request that does not meet all the above conditions.</p>

  <h2>4. Warranty</h2>
  <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise on the product listing or invoice, all products are sold <strong>without any manufacturer or seller warranty</strong>.</p>
  <p>Some branded products may carry the original manufacturer's warranty — this will be clearly indicated at the time of sale. In such cases, warranty claims must be handled directly with the manufacturer according to their terms.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property & Copyright</h2>
  <p>All logos, trademarks, product images, photographs, and branding elements on this website are protected under intellectual property laws.</p>
  <p>Visitors and customers are strictly prohibited from capturing, taking, reproducing, downloading, distributing, modifying, or using any images, logos, product photographs, or visual content for any purpose without our prior written permission. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.</p>

  <h2>6. Website & Source Code Copyright</h2>
  <p>The design, layout, structure, source code, scripts, and all other elements of this website are the intellectual property of <strong>Your Company Name</strong>.</p>
  <p>Copying, reproducing, reverse-engineering, or using any part of this website's code or design for commercial or personal projects without explicit written authorization is strictly forbidden.</p>

  <h2>7. Pricing & Availability</h2>
  <p>All prices are subject to change without prior notice. We reserve the right to correct any pricing errors that may occur.</p>
  <p>Product availability is not guaranteed. We will make reasonable efforts to fulfill orders.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, <strong>KAUSHAR INVESTMENT (Pty) Ltd</strong> shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of or inability to use our products or services.</p>
